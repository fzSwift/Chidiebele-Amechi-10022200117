## Chapter 1: The Spark—Mapping My Vision
*Date Started: [Current Date]*

### 1.1 Project Overview and Objectives

**Project Title:** EcoGhana Electronics - Sustainable Tech Marketplace

**Project Type:** E-commerce Platform

**Niche:** Ghanaian Eco-Electronics Store

**Primary Objectives:**
1. To develop a fully functional cloud-based e-commerce platform
2. To implement sustainable shopping features (carbon footprint calculator, eco-score for products)
3. To demonstrate full SDLC implementation with cloud deployment
4. To incorporate Ghana-local payment and delivery integrations

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Implement user authentication and authorization
2. Create admin dashboard for product and order management
3. Integrate with cloud services for scalability
4. Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop

**Unique Selling Points:**
- Carbon footprint calculator for each purchase
- Ghana-specific payment methods (MTN Mobile Money, AirtelTigo Cash)
- Local delivery tracking integration
- Eco-rating system for products

### 1.2 Scope Definition and Stakeholders

**In-Scope:**
- User registration and authentication
- Product browsing and search
- Shopping cart and checkout process
- Order management and tracking
- Admin dashboard for CRUD operations
- Payment gateway integration
- Cloud deployment and CI/CD pipeline

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Physical inventory management
- International shipping logistics
- Advanced AI recommendations (beyond basic)
- Mobile app development (web-only)

**Stakeholder Matrix:**

| Stakeholder | Role | Interest/Needs | My Insight |
|-------------|------|----------------|------------|
| **End Customers** | Primary users | Easy shopping, secure payments, delivery tracking | Through simulated chat: Customers want "buy now, pay later" options and local delivery estimates |
| **Admin/Store Owner** | Platform manager | Product management, order processing, analytics | Needs intuitive dashboard with bulk operations |
| **Delivery Partners** | External service | Integration with their tracking systems | API documentation must be clear and standardized |
| **Payment Providers** | External service | Secure transaction processing | MTN Mobile Money API requires specific authentication flows |
| **Developer (Me)** | System builder | Scalable, maintainable code, clear documentation | Must balance innovation with project timeline constraints |
